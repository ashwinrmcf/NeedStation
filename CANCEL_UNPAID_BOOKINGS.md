# Cancel Unpaid Bookings Feature

## Overview
Users can now cancel bookings that haven't been paid yet. Once payment is completed, the cancel option is hidden and cancellation is prevented.

## Changes Made

### ✅ Frontend - CartNew.jsx

**Added Cancel Button for Unpaid Bookings:**
```javascript
{/* Cancel button - only show if payment not completed */}
{booking.status !== 'PAYMENT_COMPLETED' && booking.paymentStatus !== 'PAID' && (
  <button
    onClick={() => onCancelRequest(booking)}
    disabled={cancellingBookingId === booking.id}
    style={{
      padding: '0.5rem 1rem',
      fontSize: '0.8rem',
      color: '#dc2626',
      background: 'rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.1)',
      border: '1px solid rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.3)',
      borderRadius: '6px',
      cursor: cancellingBookingId === booking.id ? 'default' : 'pointer',
      transition: 'all 0.2s',
      fontWeight: '600',
      whiteSpace: 'nowrap'
    }}
  >
    {cancellingBookingId === booking.id ? 'Cancelling...' : 'Cancel Booking'}
  </button>
)}
```

**Button Placement:**
- Shows next to "View Quotation" button
- Only visible for ASSIGNED/CONFIRMED status
- Hidden if payment is completed

### ✅ Backend - BookingServiceNew.java

**Added Payment Status Check:**
```java
// Prevent deletion if payment is completed
if ("PAYMENT_COMPLETED".equals(booking.getStatus()) || 
    "PAID".equals(booking.getPaymentStatus())) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Cannot cancel booking - payment has been completed");
}
```

**Deletion Process:**
1. Check if booking exists
2. Verify payment is not completed ✅ NEW!
3. Delete sub-services
4. Delete formality data
5. Delete booking record

## Booking Status Flow with Cancellation

```
1. User books service
   Status: PENDING_WORKER_ASSIGNMENT
   ✅ Can Cancel
   ↓
2. Worker accepts
   Status: ASSIGNED/CONFIRMED
   ✅ Can Cancel
   ↓
3. Quotation provided
   Status: ASSIGNED/CONFIRMED
   ✅ Can Cancel (before accepting quotation)
   ↓
4. User accepts quotation
   Status: ASSIGNED/CONFIRMED
   ✅ Can Cancel (before payment)
   ↓
5. User completes payment
   Status: PAYMENT_COMPLETED
   ❌ Cannot Cancel (button hidden)
   ↓
6. Worker starts service
   Status: IN_PROGRESS
   ❌ Cannot Cancel
   ↓
7. Service completed
   Status: COMPLETED
   ❌ Cannot Cancel
```

## Cancel Button Visibility Logic

### ✅ **Shows Cancel Button When:**
- Status is `PENDING_WORKER_ASSIGNMENT` (Finding Worker)
- Status is `ASSIGNED` or `CONFIRMED` (Worker Confirmed)
- Payment status is NOT `PAID`
- Booking status is NOT `PAYMENT_COMPLETED`

### ❌ **Hides Cancel Button When:**
- Payment status is `PAID`
- Booking status is `PAYMENT_COMPLETED`
- Status is `IN_PROGRESS`
- Status is `COMPLETED`

## API Endpoint

```
DELETE /api/bookings/{bookingId}/cancel
```

**Request:**
```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/bookings/11/cancel
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Booking cancelled and deleted successfully"
}
```

**Error Response (Payment Completed):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Cannot cancel booking - payment has been completed"
}
```

## User Experience

│ Booking #BK-20251031-00002             │
│                                         │

## Database Impact

### When Booking is Cancelled:

**Deleted Records:**
1. ✅ `booking_sub_services` - All related sub-services
2. ✅ `booking_formality_data` - All formality data
3. ✅ `bookings` - The booking record itself

**NOT Deleted:**
- User account
- Service definitions
- Worker records

### When Cancellation is Prevented:

**Protected Records:**
- ✅ `payments` - Payment record remains
- ✅ `bookings` - Booking record remains
- ✅ All related data remains intact

## Security

### ✅ **Frontend Protection:**
- Button hidden if payment completed
- Condition: `status !== 'PAYMENT_COMPLETED' && paymentStatus !== 'PAID'`

### ✅ **Backend Protection:**
- Throws error if payment completed
- Check: `"PAYMENT_COMPLETED".equals(status) || "PAID".equals(paymentStatus)`
- Returns 500 error with message

### ✅ **Double Protection:**
Even if someone bypasses frontend, backend will reject the request.
