# My Bookings Page - Dynamic Data Integration

## Overview
The My Bookings page now fetches **real data from the database** and shows **only paid bookings** (bookings where payment has been completed successfully).

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ Removed Static Data
- **Before**: Hardcoded mock bookings array with 4 sample bookings
- **After**: Empty array that gets populated from API

### ‚úÖ Added API Integration
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchBookings = async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/bookings/user/${userId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    
    // Filter only paid bookings
    const paidBookings = data.bookings.filter(booking => 
      booking.paymentStatus === 'PAID' || 
      booking.status === 'PAYMENT_COMPLETED'
    );
    
    setBookings(transformedBookings);
  };
}, [user]);
```

### ‚úÖ Payment Status Filter
Only shows bookings where:
- `paymentStatus === 'PAID'` OR
- `status === 'PAYMENT_COMPLETED'`

**Excluded statuses:**
- `PENDING_WORKER_ASSIGNMENT` (no worker yet)
- `ASSIGNED` (worker accepted, no payment)
- `CONFIRMED` (quotation provided, no payment)

### ‚úÖ Data Transformation
Backend data is transformed to match frontend format:

| Backend Field | Frontend Field | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| `bookingNumber` | `id` | Booking identifier |
| `serviceName` | `serviceName` | Service name |
| `assignedWorkerName` | `providerName` | Worker name |
| `quotationAmount` | `amount` | Payment amount |
| `fullAddress` | `address` | Service location |
| `phone` | `phone` | Customer phone |
| `preferredDate` | `serviceDate` | Service date |
| `preferredTime` | `serviceTime` | Service time |
| `status` | `status` | Mapped status |

### ‚úÖ Status Mapping
```javascript
const statusMap = {
  'PAYMENT_COMPLETED': 'confirmed',
  'IN_PROGRESS': 'confirmed',
  'COMPLETED': 'completed',
  'CANCELLED': 'cancelled'
};
```

### ‚úÖ Loading States

**1. Loading State**
```
üîÑ Loading your bookings...

```

**2. Error State**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Error loading bookings
