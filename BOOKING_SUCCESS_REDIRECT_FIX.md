# Booking Success Page Redirect - Fixed ✅

## Issue
After successful payment, the page was redirecting to home page instead of the booking success page.

## Root Cause
The backend response changed from returning `bookingId` (singular) to `bookingIds` (plural array), but the frontend wasn't updated to handle this new format.

## Changes Made

### 1. **CartNew.jsx** - Updated Payment Verification
```javascript
// Before
navigate('/booking-success', { 
  state: { 
    bookingId: result.bookingId,
    amount: total,
    services: cartItems
  }
});

// After ✅
navigate('/booking-success', { 
  state: { 
    bookingIds: result.bookingIds || acceptedQuotations.map(q => q.id),
    bookingId: result.bookingIds?.[0] || acceptedQuotations[0]?.id,
    amount: total,
    services: acceptedQuotations,
    paymentDetails: {
      subtotal: subtotal,
      platformFee: platformFee,
      gst: gst,
      discount: discountAmount,
      total: total
    }
  }
});
```

### 2. **BookingSuccess.jsx** - Updated to Handle New Data

**State Extraction:**
```javascript
// Before
const { bookingId, amount, services } = location.state || {};

// After ✅
const { bookingId, bookingIds, amount, services, paymentDetails } = location.state || {};
const displayBookingId = bookingId || (bookingIds && bookingIds[0]);
const bookingCount = bookingIds?.length || 1;
```

**Payment Details Display:**
```javascript
// Now shows full breakdown
- Subtotal: ₹2,000
- Platform Fee: ₹49
- GST (18%): ₹369
- Discount: -₹500 (if applied)
─────────────────────
- Total Paid: ₹1,918
```
